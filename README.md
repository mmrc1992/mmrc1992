# Hello! I'm Micaela! UX/UI designer, QA manual and front end (JavaScript) student.
## About me

Hello! I'm a UX designer with a focus on writing and research, complemented by knowledge in front-end development and QA. I'm currently studying QA Automation through the Code Your Future program at Globant University. 

I'm also currently pursuing advanced studies in Anthropological Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), where I've gained a solid foundation in research methodologies and statistical analysis. This training in research has equipped me with essential skills to understand and analyze data, which is vital in fields like UX/UI Design. By gaining insights into human behavior and preferences in web services and apps, I am able to make informed decisions that enhance user experience.
 
My goal is to apply this knowledge to improve the effectiveness of digital solutions and contribute to making data-informed decisions. I'm excited to utilize this interdisciplinary skill set to drive innovative solutions and collaborate effectively in diverse teams.
